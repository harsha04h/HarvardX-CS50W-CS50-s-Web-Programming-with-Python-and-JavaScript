        To go to next line we use "[br]" tag. It doesn't have any end tag.
        <br>
        The next tag is "[pre]" which is used to display text as it is, i.e. , same space between lines that is written inside the tag,same format, size,space.
        <br>
        <pre>DEMONSTRATION    OF     THE    ABOVE    TAG</pre> 
        without    the    pre    tag   (extra spaces like above would be removed by default)
        <br>
        The next tag "[hr]" is used for thematic brk in html page-horizontal rule, used to separate content in html page and it has no end tag.
        <br>
        the next tag is "[div]" which is used to divide your webpage into multiple sections and it does have a closing tag
        <hr>
        The extra tags that we used in this page were pre,br,hr,div,and we used style to increase the font-size of the heading to 60px.
